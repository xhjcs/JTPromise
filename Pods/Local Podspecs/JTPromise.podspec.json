  "summary": "A lightweight, thread-safe Promise library for Swift and Objective-C, with a JavaScript-like API.",
  "description": "Promise is a lightweight, thread-safe implementation of the Promise pattern in Swift, designed to work seamlessly with both Swift and Objective-C projects. \nIts API is fully consistent with JavaScript's Promise, making it intuitive for developers familiar with modern JavaScript asynchronous workflows. \nPromise simplifies handling asynchronous operations by supporting easy chaining of tasks, robust error handling, and a clean, manageable syntax. \n\nUsing os_unfair_lock for efficient synchronization, this library ensures fast and safe execution in concurrent environments. Whether you're working on \na Swift or Objective-C project, Promise provides a small, flexible, and powerful tool to streamline your asynchronous code.",
